- Connections. We keep track of how you interact with other users, for example when you share content or when you join a group.
- Device data. We collect information related to your device, such as the operating system and software version.

How we use your data
- User information. We use your username and email address to give you secure access to the App. We also use them to communicate with you when it is necessary, for example when you ask us for a password reset or when we update our policies.
- Content. Our Al-based systems analyze your content in order to offer you new features and to improve your overall experience. We also scan the media you upload to the App to make sure it is compliant with our Terms of Use.
- Connections. Understanding the way you interact with the App and with other users is key to provide a better experience. We interpret this data to come up with new features and fixes.
